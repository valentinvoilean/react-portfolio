      <blockquote cite="https://linkedin.com/in/vvoilean">
        <p>
          As a Frontend Tech Lead I worked with Valentin for one of the biggest clients in the automotive industry,
          developing a website serving potentially millions of visitors each month. The tech stack at this time was
          webpack+babeljs, SASS+Susy, jquery, several API and 3rd party integrations. Valentin improved the Frontend
          Build Setup of the project several times significantly so that his peer developers where able to work more
          efficiently (e.g. moving from ruby-sass to node-sass). He also took over the role of the FE team lead as he
          was eager to improve this particular social skillset.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the biggest plus points I see that Valentin brings to a team is his ability to keep up with a
          challenging workload and to deliver on time what business expects. I considered this is as especially
          important in an agency as Netcentric with tight deadlines on projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a company we are sad to see Valentin leave us but completely understand his reasoning. I appreciate very
          much my time working together with Valentin and wish him all the best in his future challenges!

          I worked with Valentin in Netcentric for almost 2 years where we were both Senior Frontend Developers.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the very beginning, I realized Valentin not only had an extensive knowledge of the Frontend panorama but
          he always demonstrated to be resolutive and never surrendered in front of a difficult problem, usually finding
          simple and clean solutions that helped creating a strong architecture.

      <blockquote cite="https://linkedin.com/in/vvoilean">
        <p>
          I had the pleasure to work with Valentin together on a complex web project for a German car manufacturer.
          Valentin always delivered his tasks in time and quality – for this reason, our project manager called him "the
          machine".
        </p>
        <p>
          Valentin pushes himself always forward to learn new stuff and become an even better developer. He often came
          back from the weekend surprising us with approvements – like moving from sass to libsass –which helped all
          developers to become more productive.
        </p>
        <p>
          Valentin is also a nice guy and it is fun spending time with him outside of work. I hope to work with Valentin
          on a project again sometime in the future.

          Valentin is an amazing skilled and passionated Engineer with great analytical skills and a keen eye for
          detail, always ready to discuss ideas with others in order to find the best solution to any given problem. He
          has a wide range of skills both on a variety of Frontend technologies such as Angular, React, ES6 and on the
          Backend side as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was lucky enough to work with him on the same project at Netcentric and soon found out that he is also a
          great team player and an easy-going, friendly person, making it really easy and an absolute pleasure to work
          with him and share some good lunches outside!
